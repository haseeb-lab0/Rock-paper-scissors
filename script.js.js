alert("Rock, Scissors, Paper is a simple yet universally recognized hand game played between two people, often used to make quick decisions or settle disputes in a playful manner. Despite its straightforward rulesâ€”where rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rockâ€”the game is rooted in strategy, psychology, and chance. Originating in ancient China and spreading across cultures over centuries, it has become more than just a childrenâ€™s pastime. This paper explores the origins, rules, cultural significance, and underlying strategies of Rock, Scissors, Paper, demonstrating how this seemingly simple game reflects deeper aspects of human behavior and decision-making.")
